1\. Our science contributes to research, practitioner, and regulatory communities and uses a combination of empirical data collection, experiments, and process-based modeling.

2\. We respect, welcome, support and encourage each other as we continue learning and growing as scientists and people

3\. We set, communicate, and respect boundaries amongst the group

4\. We value flexibility and cooperation amongst the group, as well as communicating when issues or challenges arise

5\. We value hard work and challenging each other as much as we value rest and taking care of our physical and mental wellbeing
