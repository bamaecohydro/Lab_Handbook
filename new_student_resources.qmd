### Student Parking Permit Registration Instructions

\*\*Students who registered for fall classes prior to July 19th must wait until their registration window opens to purchase a permit. 
Students will be notified of their permit registration date and time through their Crimson email.

\*\*All students who register for fall classes on or after July 19th will not receive an email notification. 
These students will only be required to wait 24 hours after registering for their fall classes to purchase their permit.

-   Log in to your myBama account.

-   In the Student tab under the “Campus Services” section click the link “Register for a Parking Permit”.

-   Once directed to the new site click on the link “Get Permit”.

-   Select a permit.
    The choices available depend on your residential status if you are living on campus, or what is currently available at the time of registration if you are a commuter student.

-   Choose or add a valid license plate with no dashes or spaces.
    If there is a letter ‘O’ in your license plate information be sure to enter it as a number ‘0’.

-   Choose or add an address.
    This is the address to which your permit will be mailed.
    Students who have already moved to Tuscaloosa may elect to have their permits mailed to the Transportation Services Office by entering Box 870179, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487. 
    Students will be notified by Crimson email once their permit has arrived in our office. 
    Photo identification is required when picking up a permit.

    The permit cost will be billed to your student account.

**After First Committee Meeting:** Fill out [Graduate Student Annual Evaluation Form ](https://biograd.as.ua.edu/application/)

#### **Tips for your first meeting with your committee members**

-   Start scheduling well in advance of the actual meeting. 

<!-- -->

-   Pass/Fail grading. 

<!-- -->

-   Need to reserve a room. A lot of students use the Aquatic Conference Room in Bevill (sign up outside of door 1094) or the Conference room in the BSC office. If these are not available, you can also reserve a library study room with an HDMI/TV set-up \[[Spaces by Library – The University of Alabama Libraries (ua.edu)](https://www.lib.ua.edu/using-the-library/find-a-place-to-study/)\]. If anything, email Debbie ([deads\@ua.edu](mailto:deads@ua.edu)) or Josh ([mccra016\@ua.edu](mailto:mccra016@ua.edu)) to reserve a room for you :) 

<!-- -->

-   Create a PowerPoint presentation (\~15 mins) highlighting you as a researcher, introducing yourself and the research you’ve done prior to and during your first semester, and a tentative research plan for this year and beyond at AU. Create a slide or two with coursework completed and in progress. 

<!-- -->

-   After your presentation, the committee will ask you to leave for a bit so they can discuss your research and make a decision. When you come back, they’ll let you know if you passed or failed.
